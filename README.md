# Discette

This Ember application was created using ember-cli and is designed to work with a [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) backend.

You can work with this repository on your local machine as per the instructions below. 

If you wish to make any changes, please fork this repository.  I am happy to host any repository that is forked from this at http://klavado.com.  Here is how that works:
 * Go to any subdomain at klavado.com.  eg http://myname.klavado.com
 * If that subdomain is available, claim it by clicking on the button (You will need to create an account first if you don't have one.
 * Once you've done that, leave me a message here ( http://klavado.com/users/ed_tee ) and I will deploy your fork of this discette-template to the subdomain you claimed.  Simple as that ;)
